# text_similarity


Developed a web-based application for a psychology research project to analyze memory recall similarities using transformer-based models (LLMs) from Hugging Face. The system allows participants to input their memory recalls, computes similarity scores, and stores results in Google Sheets via an automated pipeline. Integrated Google Forms for data collection and designed a user-friendly interface to enhance accessibility and usability.
